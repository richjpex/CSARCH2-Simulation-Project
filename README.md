# CSARCH2-Simulation-Project
Cache Simulation Project of Group 10 - CSARCH2 S11


## 8-way Block Set Associative, First In First Out
[Description, Python walkthrough of features?]
The program is an 8-way BSA + FIFO cache simulation. It consists of: 3 test case choices from A to C representing Sequential, Random, and Mid-repeating; An input for the amount of memory blocks the cache will simulate; A button to run the simulation once a valid input is made; and the Simulation Statistics where we can observe the memory access count, cache hit and miss counts, cache hit and miss rates, average memory access time, and total memory access time.


# Test Cases
N is the number of cache blocks.

## Test Case A
Implementation of Sequential Sequence: up to 2n Cache Blocks. Sequence repeats four times.

## Test Case B
Implementation of Random Sequence: Containing 4n blocks.


## Test Case C
Implementation of Mid-repeat blocks.
